# Netflix-Movie-Recommendation-System

# Objective
Designed and developed a comprehensive movie recommender system utilizing both traditional collaborative filtering techniques and advanced machine learning models to provide accurate and personalized movie recommendations.

# Key Contributions
## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Processed and transformed raw movie rating data into a structured format. Engineered user and movie-specific features, including biases, similarity measures, and latent factors.
## Hybrid Model Integration
Combined predictions from diverse models, including BaselineOnly, KNNBaseline, SVD, SVDpp, and XGBoost, to enhance recommendation accuracy and variety.
## Performance Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metrics. Benchmarked the hybrid models against standalone models to identify the most effective approach.

# Techniques Employed
## Collaborative Filtering
Utilized user-user and item-item collaborative filtering techniques to identify similar users and movies, respectively, improving recommendation accuracy.
## Matrix Factorization
Implemented Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and SVD++ models to capture latent factors within user-movie interactions, enabling more personalized recommendations.
## Ensemble Learning
Employed ensemble techniques to combine predictions from various models, leveraging the strengths of each approach and mitigating their weaknesses.

# Results and Impact
Achieved a significant reduction in RMSE and MAPE values through the integration of hybrid models, enhancing recommendation quality and user satisfaction.<br />
Enhanced problem-solving skills by addressing challenges related to model selection, data transformation, and feature engineering.<br />
Developed proficiency in utilizing advanced machine learning libraries (Surprise, XGBoost) and effectively communicating complex technical concepts to a non-technical audience.
